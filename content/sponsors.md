# Sponsor !!Con West!

!!Con is a tremendous amount of fun, and we think that it brings a lot of
value to its attendees, and to the programming community at large.  But
!!Con also costs money to run, and we're committed to making sure that it
remains affordable to everybody who wants to participate.

As such, we need your help to keep !!Con West open and available to all.  In
exchange, we'd love to help put your company in front of our 200+ smart,
creative, thoughtful participants.  Several sponsorship levels are
available, with more details to come soon; in the mean time, please [contact
us directly](mailto:bangbangcon.west@gmail.com) if you're considering
sponsoring the event!
