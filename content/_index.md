[!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com) (pronounced "bang bang con") is a two-day conference of ten-minute talks about the joy, excitement, and surprise of computing that's been held annually in New York [since 2014](http://bangbangcon.com/2014).  Due to [massive demand](http://composition.al/blog/2017/03/31/scaling-bangbangcon/), in 2019 we're expanding !!Con to the west coast of the US.  _!!Con West_ will be held in Santa Cruz, California, on the campus of [UC Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/), in early 2019, most likely in February/March.

The long-term solution to our inability to meet demand is for there to be a lot more conferences inspired by !!Con, in a lot more places, organized by a lot more people.  A new generation of conference organizers will need to step up.  In fact, that's already happening -- [EnthusiastiCon](https://www.enthusiasticon.de/), [Hello, Con!](http://hellocon.net/), and [StarCon](https://starcon.io/) are three examples of !!Con-inspired, independently organized events.

!!Con West, like the original !!Con, will be a two-day, single-track conference with 200-300 people in attendance and around thirty speakers.

The west-coast version of !!Con will necessarily be different from the east-coast version in certain ways.  For starters, the !!Con West venue is very different from the middle of Manhattan or Brooklyn, where all the previous !!Cons have been held, and this will have a big impact on the conference experience.  We can't expect attendees to be able to easily get to our venue on public transit, nor is it likely that attendees will be able to wander out to restaurants for lunch and be back in time for the afternoon talks.  On the other hand, it's very likely that attendees will be able to walk out of the building and three minutes later be strolling through a beautiful redwood forest.

!!Con West is organized by a new team of volunteers with help from a couple veteran members of the [the existing !!Con organizing team](http://bangbangcon.com/#organizers).  We have two goals for !!Con West. First, of course, we want to put on another great conference in the !!Con tradition. Second, we want to incubate a new generation of conference organizers. By the time we're done, every member of the !!Con West organizing team will have the skills and experience to go out and launch their own conferences, if they want to.

The [Baskin School of Engineering](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/) at UC Santa Cruz has committed to financial and logistical sponsorship of !!Con West.  Some members of the organizing team will have a UCSC affiliation.
