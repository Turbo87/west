      <description>Sponsor !!Con West! !!Con is a tremendous amount of fun, and we think that it brings a lot of value to its attendees, and to the programming community at large. But !!Con also costs money to run, and we&amp;rsquo;re committed to making sure that it remains affordable to everybody who wants to participate.
As such, we need your help to keep !!Con West open and available to all. In exchange, we&amp;rsquo;d love to help put your company in front of our 200+ smart, creative, thoughtful participants.</description>

      <description>Frequently asked questions What&amp;rsquo;s all this, then? !!Con (pronounced &amp;ldquo;bang bang con&amp;rdquo;) is a two-day conference of ten-minute talks about the joy, excitement, and surprise of computing that&amp;rsquo;s been held annually in New York since 2014. Due to massive demand, in 2019 we&amp;rsquo;re expanding !!Con to the west coast of the US. !!Con West will be held in Santa Cruz, California, on the campus of UC Santa Cruz, in early 2019, most likely in February/March.</description>
